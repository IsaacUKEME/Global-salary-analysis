_ Observations _

1.) Geographical comparison impact ðŸ˜„
Looking at the results of the data, there is a clear disparity in existence in salary grades in different regions. Countries holding the top position have higher salary averages than countries holding the bottom position. This is indicative of a higher demand for skilled workers than their counterparts. It also means that such countries' economies are doing well overall (higher disposable income for consumer spending, increased standard of living). Although some negative implications may also exist (rise in the price of goods and services, rise in the cost of doing business),
Lower-earning countries on the other hand have the opposite effect at play reflecting economic hardship and lower demand for skilled workers.
